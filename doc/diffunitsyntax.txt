INTRODUCTION                                           *diffunitsyntax*

This plugin is an additional vim syntax for diff format and highlights changed
and added diff units on word or character basis to make it possible to see the
actual inline differences. It should work well on a git wrapper plugin such as
|vim-fugitive|.

For example, a diff file in unified format will be shown like this:

    diff --git a/30a.txt b/30b.txt
    index 1f2ff6e..66d5f9f 100644
    --- a/30a.txt
    +++ b/30b.txt
    @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
     example1:
    `-`apple kiwi |grape| banana `mango` orange pear
    `+`apple kiwi banana `lemon` orange |peach| pear
     example2:
    `-`The `quick brown` fox jumps over the `lazy` dog.
    `-`The `2020` Olympic Games were held in `Tokyo`.
    `+`The `lazy` fox jumps over the `quick brown` dog.
    `+`The `2024` Olympic Games were held in `Paris`.

This syntax plugin does:
- identify either of unified, context, or normal "ed" style diff format, which
  can be provided by some program like `diff` and `git diff` commands
- find corresponding changed lines to be compared
- split each line to a list of diff units, based on the |DiffUnit|
  buffer-local or global variable
- compare them and find the changed and added units, using a builtin |diff()|
  function or a plugin specific function along with the 'diffopt' option
- show those units in single or several background-colored syntax highlights,
  based on the |DiffColors| buffer-local or global variable

In addition to those diff formats, if the file extension is ".diff" or the
'syntax' option is set to "diff", this syntax plugin identifies a file
including `git conflict markers` and shows the diff units like this:

    <<<<<<< HEAD
    example1:
    apple kiwi |grape| banana `mango` orange pear
    example2:
    The `quick brown` fox jumps over the `lazy` dog.
    The `2020` Olympic Games were held in `Tokyo`.
