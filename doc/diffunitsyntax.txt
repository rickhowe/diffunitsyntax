INTRODUCTION                                           *diffunitsyntax*

This plugin finds and highlights word or character based changed/added/deleted
diff units in a diff format, to make it possible to see the actual differences
within a line. This plugin not only works as an additional vim syntax for diff
format but also applies the intra-line diff unit highlighting on some popular
git-related plugins.

When a file name extension is ".diff" or the 'syntax' option is set to "diff",
a diff file in unified format will be shown like this:

    diff --git a/30a.txt b/30b.txt
    index 1f2ff6e..66d5f9f 100644
    --- a/30a.txt
    +++ b/30b.txt
    @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
     example1:
    `-`apple kiwi |grape| banana `mango` orange pear
    `+`apple kiwi banana `lemon` orange |peach| pear
     example2:
    `-`The `quick brown` fox jumps over the `lazy` dog.
    `-`The `2020` Olympic Games were held in `Tokyo`.
    `+`The `lazy` fox jumps over the `quick brown` dog.
    `+`The `2024` Olympic Games were held in `Paris`.

This plugin does:
- identify either of unified, context, or normal "ed" style diff format, which
  can be provided by some program like `diff` and `git diff` commands
- find a pair of corresponding changed lines to be compared in a buffer
- realign them to most similar lines if "linematch" is set in the 'diffopt'
  option
- split each line to a list of diff units, based on the |DiffUnit|
  buffer-local or global variable
- compare them and find the changed/added/deleted diff units, using a builtin
  |diff()| function or a plugin specific function along with the 'diffopt'
  option
- highlight those diff units according to syntax, text property, or extended
  mark mechanism applied on the buffer, using single or several
  background-colored highlight groups, based on the |DiffColors| buffer-local
  or global variable

In addition to those standard diff formats, this plugin identifies a file
including `git conflict markers` and `diff indicators ('-'/'+' and '<'/'>')`,
and then shows the diff units.

Diff unit highlighting on plugins

In some popular git-related plugins, to show 'git diff' output and to preview
a diff hunk in normal, preview, and popup/floating windows, another
highlighting mechanism such as text property or extended mark is used instead
of diff syntax. This plugin applies the intra-line diff unit highlighting and
show actual differences on them, based on the |DiffUnitSyntax| buffer-local or
global variable, on the following plugins (you are welcome to introduce more
plugins to cover!):

In normal window:
|vim-fugitive|
|neogit.nvim|
|vim-gin|

In preview and popup/floating windows:
|gitsigns.nvim|
|vim-gitgutter|
|vim-siginify|
